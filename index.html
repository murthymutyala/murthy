        <h1>FUTURE WORK</h1>
        </center>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our approach evaluates the performance using a mathematical metric. However, it
is the human who finally judges the goodness of the generated hierarchy. Therefore,
subjective evaluations that are conducted on human subjects are necessary for constructing a human-readable hierarchy. The result of this work will be shown to several
human subjects to evaluate the result in the near future. In addition, the constructed
hierarchies are to be used for text categorization. Both subjective and objective evaluations of the performance of text categorization will also be conducted. Finally, we will
compare the effectiveness of using our hierarchies for text categorization with the
hierarchies constructed by some other methods.</p>

        <h1> CONCLUSIONS </h1>
        </center>
            <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this chapter, we presented a method to automatically generate category hierarchies and identify category themes. The documents were first transformed to a set of
feature vectors. The vectors were used as input to train the self-organizing map. Two
maps—the word cluster map and the document cluster map—were obtained by labeling
the neurons in the map with words and documents, respectively. An automatic category
generation process was applied to the document cluster map to find some dominating
neurons that are centroids of some super-clusters. The category terms of super-clusters
were also determined. The same processes were applied recursively to each superclusters to reveal the structure of the categories. Our method used neither humanprovided terms nor predefined category structure. Text categorization can easily be
achieved in our method.

        <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Data Mining (DM) may often seem a highly effective tool for companies to be
using in their business endeavors, there are a number of pitfalls and/or barriers that
may impede these firms from properly budgeting for DM projects in the short term. This
chapter indicates that the pitfalls of DM can be categorized into several distinct
categories. We explore the issues of accessibility and usability, affordability and
efficiency, scalability and adaptability, systematic patterns vs. sample-specific patterns,
explanatory factors vs. random variables, segmentation vs. sampling, accuracy and
cohesiveness, and standardization and verification. Finally, we present the technical
challenges regarding the pitfalls of DM.</P>
